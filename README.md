This repository contains an implementation of CycleGAN, a deep learning model for unpaired image-to-image translation. CycleGAN is capable of learning mappings between two image domains without the need for paired data. This project focuses on translating images between two domains:
celebrity photographs and Monet-style paintings.

We map celebrity face images to monet art styles
